## About The Project!

Wubba Lubba Dub Dub is a site for Rick and Morty fans to check out all the characters shown to us so far in their multiverse. It is intended for users to find out what episodes the characters are in and if they are alive or deceased at this time. Users can also add their most liked characters to their favorites!. 

This was an assignment from Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program, known as the Show Case project. Show Case is a solo project focused on applying the knowledge we have learned about React and creating an application using an API of our choice. 

  

With this application users are able to view a Rick and Morty Characters, fetched from a RESTful API. To learn more about a character, the user can click on their image.  Users can also favorite their most beloved characters.
